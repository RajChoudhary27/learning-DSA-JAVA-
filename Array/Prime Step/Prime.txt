Ques 1 ->WAP to swap elements of given array pairwise
[1,2,3,4,5]
[2,1,4,3,5]

Ques 2 ->You are given a sorted integer array nums (sorted in ascending order) and an integer target.
Your task is to:
Return the index if the target is found.
If not found, return the index where it should be inserted so that the array remains sorted.

Ques 3->given an array we have to find the frequency of an given element. in O(nlogn)

Ques 4->. WAP to remove duplicate elements from a sorted array of integers.
Constraints: Time complexity should be O(n) and space complexity should be O(1)

Ques 5-> WAP to arrange given array containing only 0's and 1's in such a way that all the 0's comes before all 1's.

Ques 6-> we have to sorted array. wap to merge that array to single array.

Ques 7->WAP to find median of two sorted array.

Ques 8->Single Number Problem

Ques 9->Plus one Problem
[1,2,4] -> [1,2,5]
