1️⃣ Sort Colors (Dutch National Flag)
LeetCode #75

📌 Problem Statement
Given an array nums with n objects colored:
0 → red
1 → white
2 → blue
Sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, in the order red, white, blue.
You must solve it without using the library sort function.


2️⃣ Merge Two Sorted Arrays
LeetCode #88

📌 Problem Statement
You are given two sorted integer arrays:
nums1 (size m + n)
nums2 (size n)
Merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.
The first m elements in nums1 are valid; the last n elements are 0 placeholders.
Modify nums1 in-place.

3️⃣ Kth Largest Element in an Array
LeetCode #215

📌 Problem Statement
Given an integer array nums and an integer k,
Return the kth largest element in the array.
Note: It is the kth largest in sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
You must solve it better than O(n log n).

4️⃣ Sort Characters by Frequency
LeetCode #451

📌 Problem Statement
Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.
Return the sorted string.
If two characters have the same frequency, any order is fine.

5️⃣ Valid Anagram
LeetCode #242

📌 Problem Statement
Given two strings s and t,
Return true if t is an anagram of s, otherwise return false.
An anagram is formed by rearranging letters using all original characters exactly once.

6️⃣ Relative Sort Array
LeetCode #1122

📌 Problem Statement
Given two arrays:
arr1
arr2
All elements of arr2 are distinct and appear in arr1.
Sort arr1 such that:
Elements in arr2 appear first in the same relative order as arr2.
Remaining elements appear at the end in ascending order.

7️⃣ Minimum Swaps to Sort

❗ Not a direct standard LeetCode title, but similar concept appears in:
Closest official style:
LeetCode #2471 – Minimum Number of Operations to Sort a Binary Tree by Level
(Conceptually similar but different structure)
Classic array version (commonly asked in interviews):

📌 Problem Statement (Array Version)
Given an array of distinct integers, find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array in ascending order.

8️⃣ Largest Number
LeetCode #179

📌 Problem Statement
Given a list of non-negative integers nums,
Arrange them such that they form the largest possible number.
Return the result as a string.
If result contains leading zeros, return "0".
