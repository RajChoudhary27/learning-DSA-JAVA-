Find the contiguous subarray of length k that has the maximum average value.
Return the maximum average.

2️⃣ First Negative Integer in Every Window of Size K
❗ Not an official standard LeetCode title.
Mostly asked on GFG / Interview practice.

📌 Problem Statement
Given an array and an integer k,
For every window of size k, print the first negative number in that window.
If no negative number exists, print 0.

3️⃣ Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
LeetCode #3

📌 Problem Statement
Given a string s,
Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Substring must be contiguous.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter after performing at most k replacements.

5️⃣ Minimum Window Substring

LeetCode #76
📌 Problem Statement
Given two strings s and t,
Return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window.
If no such substring exists, return empty string.
